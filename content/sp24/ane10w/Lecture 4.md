## David's Jerusalem
Most kings held a dynastic period of around 40 years.
- King Saul ca. 1050-1010 BCE
The City of David is mostly unpopulated in the 19th century.
- Fifty feet under the modern street separating the city of David from the Western wall is the Roman pavement for the city of Jerusalem.
The Givati Excavation within the central valley is currently underway.
### The Giv'ati Parking Lot
Excavation of the parking lot is revealing that there is a manmade cliff that goes down around 50 meters where there is sheer bedrock cut and carved along the side. An enormous amount of missing rock that was filled with dirt.
- Someone was quarrying that place just to the north of the city of Jerusalem.
- There is one part of the city where there is easy access to the city of David, the north, and they start cutting rock out in order to create a valley at the south point to create a valley so that they can't attack from the North.
	- This creates an artificial separation from the City of David and the Eastern Hill.
	- At the north point there is an open air altar, the high part of Jerusalem.
**TL;DR**: Separating the City of David and the Eastern Ridge is a quarried moat that allows for more defensive capability from attackers in the North. People settled in the City of David because of the Gihon spring.
## Tribal Period (1150-960 BCE)
This was the beginning of the "Iron Age".
- At the time, the ark of the covenant was in a tent and they wanted the ark of the covenant in Jerusalem
- The Book of Judges highlights the gradual ineffectiveness of the different tribal parts, which enters the Kings.
## Kings
Israel's first kings in the book of Samuel and Kings
- Saul 1050-1010 BCE
- David 1010 -970 BCE
	- Is the more successful one, is going to bring the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem and attempts to build a temple in Jerusalem for the Ark of the Covenant to sit.
### The Outrage at Gibeah
> In those days when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite, residing in the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah
> Judges 19:1

They decide to go to Gibeah since Jebus of the Jebusites (City of David) was too out of the way of the Watershed Road.
This man allows a bunch of men to rape his concubine to death. Even offers his daughter.
The subtext is in "those days when there was no king in Israel".
- Almost a warning story about a tribe without a King?
### Conquest of David (1000 BCE)

> The king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, "You will not come in here, even the blind and the lame will turn you back" - thinking, "David cannot come in here".
> 2 Samuel 5

This tells us that even the weakest can defend this city. It is so fortified. He took up the Stronghold of Zion, or the place with the open air altar.
**Tsinnor** - Warren's shaft, shaft going from Gihon spring to the Kidron valley.
- Maybe this is a conduit under the city walls like a sewage pipeline, not Warren's shaft. A more plausible explanation.
	- Reminiscent of the Shawshank Redemption prison exit.
**Millo** - A stepped stone structure coming from the Kidron Valley to the City of David
- Millo means "the thing that's filled", in a narrow hill, like the city of David, you need to widen and flatten the top of the hill, to "fill out" the hill. It leads to the Stronghold of Zion.
Following is 2 Samuel 6 where the "Ark of the Covenant" is brought into Jerusalem.
- Placed in the open air altar at the top of the hill.

> As the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michal daughter of Saul looked out of the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in his heart.
> 2 Samuel 6

Significant motif in Israel, Woman in the Window, Ivory Carving - Iron Age of Israel
## A "House" for David

>the king said to the prophet Nathan, "See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God stays in a tent"
>2 Samuel 7

Once you put up a building, God can't move anymore. You are institutionalizing God.
- You've made sacred space only in the spot of Jerusalem.

> Moreover, the Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house.
> 2 Samuel 7:11

**House** - Dynasty or place of rest, here they are probably talking about a political house.
In the Tel Dan, Israel, they found an inscription called the Tel Dan inscription
The first non-biblical mention of King David, and the dynastic lineage of the House of David.

>He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish his kingdom. Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me; your throne shall be established forever.
>2 Samnuel 7:16

King Solomon is "He". He flips the script on David, with God saying that I will make for YOU a house, not you making a house for me.
By inserting his comment between two affirmations of establishing his Kingdom (repetitive resumption) 

>**and I will establish his kingdom**. *He shall build a house for my name,* **and I will establish the throne of his Kingdom forever**
>2 Samuel 7:12-13

The Bible is a diochronic text. I get it it's this thing, but it's a text that's copied and passed along generation after generation, inserting text into it after the text was originally composed.
