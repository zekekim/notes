## Introduction
Prof. William Schniedewind
- Professor of Hebrew Bible and Ancient Judaism
**The Cloverleaf Map** 1581 CE famously depicts Jerusalem as The Center of the World - Sacred Geography.
- Geography shapes history, Ex. Red and Blue states map to urban vs rural geography.
- Jerusalem is the intersection of Europe, Asia and Africa and pitted between the Mediterranean Sea and the Desert, it harbors the east and west
	- Earthquakes due to continental plates, winds from ocean and desert
Jerusalem is within the **Fertile Crescent**
- Rainfall is very unpredictable, just like Southern California
	- Extended dry periods and rainfall periods
### Local Physical Geography
#### Routes and Highways (Communication)
Situated in the middle of the Judean Plateau on the "Watershed Road"
- If you pour a glass on the watershed road, half the water goes into the Mediterranean half the road goes into the Nile River.
- "The whole plateau stands aloof, waterless, on the road to nowhere." - G.A. Smith, *Historical Geography of the Holy Land*
Adjacent to the Coastal Highway, which goes from Egypt to Mesopotamia.

> The irony of Jerusalem - it should be insignificant due to its unfortunate location and geography, but it is the "City of God". Cited in the idea of the *New Jerusalem* where heaven will come to earth.
#### Valleys
Jerusalem has mainly been taken from the north since there are no natural valleys or barriers north of Jerusalem.

Valleys:
1. Hinnom
2. central
3. Kidron

Hills:
1. Western
2. Temple Mount and city of David
3. Mt. of Olives
4. Mt.? Zion - Pitted between the Mt. of Olives and the Western Hill

Jerusalem being surrounded by the hills lending to the analogies written in the Bible - Psalms 125:2, Isaiah 2:2
#### Water
The main reason it was favorable to settle in Jerusalem was due to its supply of water.
**Gihon Spring** - On the slope of the Kidron Valley which led to the Siloam pool via the Siloam Channel, irrigated King's Gardens.
- The water was accessible through Warren's Shaft within the city.
Water in Biblical Texts
- Genesis 2 *Rivers of the Garden of Eden*
	- The Gihon is referenced here, an allusion to the Garden of Eden as the second river.
- Revelations 22 *The River of the New Jerusalem*
	- Referencing Gihon (probably?) as the river for the water of life in the last days in New Jerusalem.
### Sacred Geography
#### Jewish
**The First Temple** built first under King Solomon
- Solomon's Temple - built in 850 BC and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC
- 2nd Temple - rebuilt in 515 BC, aggrandized in 20 BC with the Western/Wailing Wall by Herod, and destroyed in 70 BC by the Romans.
	- Herod built the Western Wall or a huge platform for the original temple to be built on since he could not touch the original instructions for the temple.
- Dome of the Rock - Rebuilt in 691 CE . Still stands today.
- This area is called the **Temple Mount** or the **Haram esh-Shaerif**.
**The Western Wall** is where people stuff their prayers, praying at the wailing wall.
#### Christianity
- Two Gray Domes of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
