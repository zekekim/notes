## How do People Differentiate "Sacred Space"
Today we are focusing on Genesis 2-3
New Testament: Stories of Jesus
Quran: Journey of the Prophet

## What is the Bible?
The Bible was written at a time where books didn't even exist.  Bible from *biblia* "books"
- scrolls of individual books.
There are many different bibles, the **Hebrew bible**, **Old Testament**, etc.

The Jewish Bible is split into 3 different sections:
- Torah (or Pentateuch)
	- Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus Numbers, Deuteronomy
- Prophets
	- Joshua - 2 Kings, Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.)
- Psalms

The Greek (Christian) Bible:
- Septuagint
	- Translated into Greek by Jews in Alexandria beginning in the 3rd century BCE
	- Adopted later by the Christians
- Greek Bible (Four Sections)
	- Torah
	- Historical Books
		- Joshua-Kings, Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah
	- Prophets
	- Wisdom Books
		- Psalms, Proverbs, Job, etc.
## Who wrote the Hebrew Bible?
Proverbs 25:1 - "these are also proverbs of King Solomon copied down by the scribes of King Hezekiah"
- Who? Scribal Communities
- Where? Mostly in Jerusalem
	- The Scribes who wrote and collected the Bible were mostly located in Jerusalem
- When? ca. 1000 BCE - 200 BCE
- What are the implications? The "Bible" is an anthology of texts with a historical timeline.
## Center of the World - Axis Mundi
Mircea Eliade, *The Sacred and Profane* (1957)
- Classic religious thinker, thinking about sacred space, and often drawing back to Jerusalem
- Idea of the Center of the World, or **Axis Mundi**
There are a multitude of different stories that place Jerusalem in the center of the world.
- Garden of Eden, Genesis 2-3
- Cosmic Mountain, Genesis 22; Exodus 3,24
- Place of Prayer, Western Wall
- Place of the Underworld, Valley of Hinnom (*Gai-Hinnom* in Hebrew or *Gehenna* in Greek); "Hell" Matthew 5:22
- Below the Islamic Dome of the Rock, "Well of the Souls"; Resting place of the dead
## 4 Aspects of Religious Space
Thomas Tweed, *4 Aspects of "Space" in Religion*
- **Differentiated**: Religious space is a particular space, set apart.
- **Kinetic**: Religion and Space have *historical dimensions*: the meaning and function of this space can change over time.
- **Interrelated**: Religion is one cultural force that interacts with and is ultimately inseparable from political, social and economic forces.
- **Generated and Generative**: Spaces are *made* and Spaces *make*. People *make* sacred spaces like Jerusalem and in turn these sacred places *make* meaning and significance for those who visit or inhabit sacred places.
## The Sacred Spaces
- The Temple
- The Dome of the Rock
- Church of the Holy Sepulchur
### Kinetic of Mount Zion
Mount Zion started at the City of David, then moves to the Temple Mount as that is the center of religious activity in Jerusalem, then moves to the Western Hill in the medieval times.
- The Original Space was at Solomon's temple, built in 950 BC then destroyed in 586 BC by the Romans
- the 2nd Temple was Rebuilt in 515 BC, Aggrandized by Herod the Great creating the Temple mount in 20 BC, then destroyed in 70 CE
- Dome of the Rock (Haram) was built in 691 CE and the Western Wall was built and became a holy place in Judaism after this point also.
### The Temples
Detailed depiction of the architecture of Solomon's Temple in the Bible.
The Ark of the Covenant: Symbol of the physical presence of God
#### Islamic Era
In addition to the Dome of the Rock, there is Al-Aqsa Mosque, or the farther mosque, that was created due to the lack of space in the original temple.
#### Dome of the Rock and the Foundation Stone
- Temple Mount/ Haram's large protruding rock, known as the Foundation Stone. Believed to be the Foundation of the World.
- Draws on Isaiah's prophecy *Isaiah 28:16*
## Rivers of the Garden of Eden
Genesis 2 - "The name of the second river is **Gihon**; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush."
Many historians have tried to fit this sacred space depiction into a physical space for the Garden of Eden, but professor thinks its really silly and unrealistic to pin the sacred space of the Garden of Eden into just a physical space.The Gihon, Euphrates, etc. are descriptions of sacred spaces.
Genesis 3 -  The garden is guarded by a cherubim.
## Mount Mariah
Genesis 22 - "Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, go to the land of **Moriah**, and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one of the *mountains* that I shall show you."
"burnt-offering, my son" - there are no commas actually in Hebrew, so it is our decision to put it there.
"So Abraham called that place 'The Lord will provide'; as it is said to this day, 'On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided'". Does not give too much of a hint of where we are.
### So where is Moriah?
The mountain of the Lord, referenced in Psalms 24:3, Isaiah 2:3
2 Chronicles 3:1 - "Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem on *Mount Moriah*, where the Lord had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had designated"
- A symbolic/kinetic space written about 400 BC, centuries after the Book of Genesis
- *Professor believes that Mount Moriah is Jerusalem*
